    "Unfortunately, Google Colab doesn't support Java runtimes outside of some hacky workarounds, so you'll need to do this lab on your own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to https://junit.org/junit5/ and follow the instructions to install JUnit 5. You'll need to install the JUnit 5 platform and the JUnit 5 Jupiter engine. You can do this with Maven or Gradle, or you can download the JAR files directly. You'll also need to install a Java JDK if you don't already have one, but hopefully you do at this point!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using an IDE, such as VSCode, IntelliJ, or Eclipse, you'll be able to either install a JUnit plugin or use the built-in JUnit support to run your tests. If you're not using an IDE, you can use the command line to run your tests. It's a good idea to get familiar with both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "This time around, there's more onus on you to figure out how to get things working. https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/ has all of the info you'll need to get started. It's good practice to get used to installing packages from their own docs.\n",
